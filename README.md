# Route-Manager-Website
Development of an interactive website that allows you to view collection routes and their respective tonnages
To use these files you need to install GeoServer and all of it's dependencies. Here is the site for the Windows download:
http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/win_installer.html
Once GeoServer is up and running you can clone the files in this repo to the webapps folder. If you're running localhost it should be here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\GeoServer 2.10.3\webapps.
RouteReady.jpg is an image of what it should look like
Looking for any help create a summary table in the right hand margin for total route tonnages.
